## Current Project State

FlorAI-Mobile is a React Native (Expo) application providing AI-powered plant identification and care with advanced diagnostics. The project has made significant progress with core features implemented and premium functionality now available.

### Completed Components & Features

- Full project structure and configuration using Expo and TypeScript
- Comprehensive UI component library aligned with design system
- Advanced plant identification with Plant.id API integration
- Python microservice for plant identification and disease diagnosis
- Secure Node.js/Express backend endpoints
- Privacy consent screens and Privacy Dashboard UI
- User service for privacy and data management operations
- Premium feature onboarding flow with PremiumFeatureModal component
- usePremiumFeaturePrompt hook for managing premium feature access
- Advanced diagnostics screen with premium feature integration
- Subscription management and payment processing

### In-Progress Items

- Proprietary plant identification model development (following roadmap)
- Enhanced plant identification with multiple image support
- Search and filtering capabilities
- User accounts and cloud synchronization
- UI/UX refinements: animations, accessibility, responsive design

### Known Issues

- Jest testing challenges remain; using alternative testing approaches
- Some edge cases in premium feature access need additional handling

## Tech Stack & Architectural Decisions

### Current Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React Native (Expo)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **State Management**: [To be determined]
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **UI Components**: Custom components with potential for UI library integration
- **Testing**: Jest (configuration in progress)
- **API Integration**: [To be determined]
- **AI Model**: [To be determined]

### Project Structure

The application follows a feature-based organization with shared components:

```
src/
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
│   ├── surfaces/     # Container-type components (Cards, etc.)
│   └── ...
├── screens/          # Screen components
├── navigation/       # Navigation configuration
├── services/         # API and external service integration
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
├── utils/            # Utility functions
└── assets/           # Images, fonts, etc.
```

## Next Steps & Priorities

Based on the current state, these are the recommended next steps to advance the project:

1. **Core Feature Implementation**: Begin implementing plant identification core functionality
2. **API Integration**: Design and implement backend service integration
3. **Camera & Image Processing**: Implement camera features for plant photos
4. **User Experience**: Refine navigation flow and UI/UX for core user journeys
5. **Testing Strategy**: Implement alternative testing approaches while Jest issues are being resolved

The detailed evaluation of next steps and technical recommendations will be provided in the project evaluation document.
