- Core plant identification fully implemented with camera integration and image processing
- Advanced plant diagnostics feature implemented with premium gating
- Premium feature onboarding flow created with contextual modal system
- Subscription management and payment processing implemented
- Plant.id API integration completed via Python microservice
- Secure Node.js/Express backend endpoints created for all plant-related features
- Privacy consent screens and Privacy Dashboard UI implemented with granular controls
- User service created for comprehensive privacy and data management operations
- Data processing pipeline established for proprietary model development
- Weather service integrated for environmental context in plant diagnostics
- Advanced sensor utility module implemented for multispectral/hyperspectral analysis

## Testing Strategy

Due to the current challenges with Jest testing in the Expo environment, we've established alternative testing approaches for ensuring the quality and reliability of the FlorAI-Mobile application.

### Alternative Testing Approaches

#### 1. Manual Testing
