## Overview

FlorAI-Mobile is an AI-powered plant identification app using Expo, React Native, TypeScript, and Supabase. The app provides advanced AI features including plant identification, disease diagnosis, and personalized care recommendations with a transparent premium experience.

This documentation is organized to serve different audiences and purposes, from high-level project planning to detailed technical specifications.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into three main categories:

- **Technical Specifications** (`/docs/specs/`): Detailed technical documentation for developers, including API specifications, data models, and architecture diagrams.
- **User Documentation** (`/docs/user-docs/`): End-user focused documentation, including user guides, feature explanations, and FAQs.
- **Development Guides** (`/docs/dev-guides/`): Guides for developers working on the project, including setup instructions, coding standards, and contribution guidelines.

## How to Update Documentation

When updating documentation, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Version Control**: Update the version number and last updated date at the top of the document.
2. **Consistent Structure**: Maintain the document structure with proper headings and sections.
3. **Cross-References**: Ensure cross-references to other documents are accurate and up-to-date.
4. **Review Process**: Have another team member review significant documentation changes.
5. **Index Updates**: When adding new documentation, update this index file accordingly.

## Next Steps

- Migrate existing documentation to the new folder structure
- Create missing documentation for key features
