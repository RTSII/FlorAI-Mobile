# FlorAI-Mobile Testing Challenges

## Summary of Testing Issues

During the development of FlorAI-Mobile, we encountered persistent issues with Jest test execution within the React Native Expo environment. While we successfully addressed TypeScript errors and import path issues, we faced a fundamental problem with Jest test execution.

### Identified Issues

1. **Test Detection vs. Execution**: Jest correctly detects test files matching standard patterns (`*.test.js`, `*.spec.js`), but fails to execute any tests within these files.
2. **Configuration Challenges**: Multiple configuration approaches were attempted, including:
   - Using the default `jest-expo` preset
   - Configuring custom test environments (`jsdom`, `node`)
   - Adjusting transformIgnorePatterns for React Native
   - Simplifying configs to minimal settings
   - Disabling watchman and other potential interfering features

3. **Test File Structure**: Various test file patterns were created to isolate issues:
   - Standard component tests (e.g., `Card.test.tsx`)
   - Simple JavaScript-only tests (e.g., `basic.spec.js`, `bare.test.js`)
   - Diagnostic test files with minimal dependencies

4. **Error Visibility**: No clear error messages explain the execution failures. Tests are detected but report "0 tests" executed.

### Technical Fixes Already Applied

1. **TypeScript and Import Errors**: Fixed import paths by adding `.tsx` extensions and updating component imports.
2. **Test Component Props**: Extended `CardProps` interface to include `imageSource` for test environments.
3. **Jest Environment**: Added `jest-environment-jsdom` for React Native component testing.
4. **Global Types**: Added Jest type definitions to resolve missing Jest globals errors.
5. **Configuration Simplification**: Trimmed Jest config to essential settings to minimize potential conflicts.

### Current Status

Testing is currently in a partially-implemented state:

- Type errors and import issues have been resolved
- Test files are properly structured and detected by Jest
- Jest configuration has been simplified to basics
- However, tests are not executing (0 tests run)

### Recommended Approaches

Since this is a new application in active development, we recommend:

1. **Proceed with Development**: Continue building core application functionality without blocking on test issues.

2. **Implement Alternative Testing Strategies**:
   - Manual testing for critical paths
   - End-to-end testing (Detox) as an alternative to unit tests when appropriate
   - Browser-based testing for web views

3. **Future Testing Solutions**:
   - Revisit Jest configuration with future Expo/React Native releases
   - Consider simpler test frameworks or direct React Native Testing Library integration
   - Potentially implement a custom test runner focused on React Native specifics

This document serves as documentation of the current testing challenges and will be updated as solutions are discovered or as testing strategies evolve with the project.
