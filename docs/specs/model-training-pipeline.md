# FlorAI Proprietary Model Training Pipeline

## Overview

This document outlines the model training pipeline for FlorAI's proprietary plant identification and diagnostics model. The pipeline is designed to leverage collected user data (with consent) along with open-source datasets to train high-accuracy models for plant identification, disease detection, and growth stage analysis.

## Architecture

The training pipeline follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Data Collection & Storage**
   - User-contributed data (with consent) via FlorAI-Mobile app
   - Open-source datasets (PlantNet-300K, PlantVillage, etc.)
   - Supabase for structured data storage
   - Supermemory.ai for semantic search and context

2. **Data Processing**
   - Data cleaning (blur detection, exposure correction)
   - Labeling workflow (species, health status, growth stage)
   - Expert review system
   - Augmentation pipeline (rotations, crops, lighting variations)

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Image feature extraction (CNN-based)
   - Metadata integration (location, season, EXIF data)
   - Environmental context integration (weather, soil conditions)
   - Sensor data processing (multispectral/hyperspectral where available)

4. **Model Training**
   - Transfer learning from established vision models
   - Multi-task learning for identification and diagnostics
   - Specialized disease detection models
   - Growth stage prediction models

5. **Evaluation & Deployment**
   - Cross-validation and test set evaluation
   - A/B testing with existing models
   - Gradual rollout to production
   - Continuous monitoring and retraining

## Technologies

The training pipeline will utilize the following technologies:

- **Python** as the primary programming language
