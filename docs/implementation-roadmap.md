   - Documentation updates
   - Code review process improvements

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Test coverage expansion
   - Automated testing improvements
   - Performance testing automation
   - Regression testing enhancements

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Regular updates of libraries and frameworks
   - Security vulnerability monitoring
   - Deprecation handling
   - Compatibility testing

4. **DevOps & CI/CD**

   - Deployment automation
   - Environment parity improvements
   - Monitoring and alerting enhancements

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks & Mitigation Strategies

1. **API Reliability**
   - Risk: Plant identification API downtime or rate limiting
   - Mitigation: Implement caching, fallback options, and graceful degradation

2. **Testing Challenges**
   - Risk: Continued Jest testing issues with Expo
   - Mitigation: Focus on E2E and manual testing while monitoring ecosystem updates

3. **Performance on Older Devices**
   - Risk: Poor performance on low-end devices
   - Mitigation: Implement progressive enhancement and performance monitoring

4. **User Adoption**
